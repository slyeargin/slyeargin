I'm a software engineer working for [NextRoll](https://nextroll.com/) on the [RollWorks](https://www.rollworks.com/) engineering team.  I'm currently learning Go and Typescript.  For the last five years, I've worked primarily in Python and React.  I enjoy functional programming and have written Erlang for production.
