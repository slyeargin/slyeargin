I'm a software engineer, currently working for [Hatch](https://hatchcare.com/). I'm learning Elixir and dusting off my Rails knowledge. For the last year I worked primarily in Go and Typescript; before that, I spent most of my time in Python and React.  I enjoy functional programming and have written Erlang for production.
